# This is a YOLOv1 Object Detection Model created by Isaac, Erin, Brian, and Patrick

Our written report was created using LaTeX. If you have any questions or need insights deeper than what's given in the codebase, please refer to the written report that is linked with the submission.

#### The script that can be run to reproduce the results is given by train.py. If you would like to test the model on custom input, please use use_model.py.

YOLOv1 is a popular object detection model already created by brilliant researchers and programmers, following the original YOLO paper developed by Joseph Redmon. Many of our implementations may be similar with other models since we followed the model instructions given in the paper.

The main similarities will lie in the model architecture whereas the main differences (our unique points) lie within the validation, training, and testing procedures. We also have a script that displays a graph of the validation loss from our model's performance.

Although the core of our model may look similar to other YOLO architectures, we tried implementing this structure ourselves using support from StackOverFlow, Youtube tutorials, and other references linked in our report.
